<p>Welcome! Pixel by Pixel is an infinite canvas meant to be filled with pixel art. It has a simple but important rule: you cannot change or erase the pixels added by others. This is to protect your work as well as that of others, so that you can devote as much time as you want to a piece, knowing that it'll not be ruined by an idiot. On the other hand, it's always possible to <emph>extend</emph> someone else's work (that is, adding pixels around someone else's work). This has the advantage of allowing well-meant artists to correct the occasional random pixels and stupid drawings done by passing-by users. If you don't want your work to be extended, you can always surround it by a block of color. This however does not guarantee that your work may not be incorporated to a larger piece.</p>

<h2>Is it the same to paint a pixel black, than to delete it?</h2>
<p>No, it's not the same. A pixel can be painted black so as to avoid others from painting it over.</p>
