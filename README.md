Pixel by Pixel
==============
An infinite canvas of collaborative pixel art

Bugs
----
* The mouse position is off by two pixels. There is a bugfix in place, but it's ugly.
* The spectrum source throws a warning, see the console. My fault or theirs?
* Sometimes the bucket doesn't paint all the pixels it should. The bug probably comes from the SQL statement.
