Pixel by Pixel
==============
An infinite canvas for collaborative pixel art.

Bugs
----
* The mouse position is off by two pixels. There is a bugfix in place in the CSS though.
* The null values sent via ajax are not received as real nulls, but as some pseudo falsy.

Tasks

* When using the bucket, if the area is limited, paint the pixels?
* Replace GET for POST ajax requests where necessary
* Preview?
* Draft pencil?
* Optimize the zoom
* Optimize pixel loading
* Understand and optimize the spectrum CSS

Further tasks
